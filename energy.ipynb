    "- Measure: it is used as an index, each measure specifies a specific observation of some building in a specific district at a specific time(year and month), therefore each measure has a uinique value. It is noted with  integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Categorical features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Month: The month the observation was made at, this value is ordinal because we can arrange month in an inner order from 1 to 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sector: This parameter denotes the sector the observation belongs to. It it a nominal feature, every value has its own name without inner order to them. \n",
    "values are:  factory/commercial/education/office/residential.\n",
    "\n",
    "- District: A parameter to denote the district the observation was taken at. It is a nominal feature, there is no inner order to the district and we can call them by name.\n",
    "Values are: 1 to 8.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numerical features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Year:  The year that the observation was made at, this feature is continious because there is not finite value to years. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Size: The square size of a floor, it does not denotes the total size of a building only the square size of floor, it is a continious value because we can always measure a bigger floor size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elevation: The ground elevation at the building's location, it is a continious data type for the infinte range of its values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Floors: This feature denotes the amount of floors in a observation building, because it represent the amount it is a numerical feature with a discrete value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built: A feature to denote the year the building was built, since its value is in years it is a continious feature like 'year' feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tmp_min (minimum tempature): A feature to specify the minum tempature measure that was taken at this observation location, tempature can measured on a scale therefore it is a a continious feature type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tmp_max (maximum tempature): A feature to specify the maximum tempature measure that was taken at this observation location, tempature can measured on a scale therefore it is a a continious feature type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tmp_mean (mean tempature): A feature to specify the mean tempature measure that was taken at this observation location, its value will be between the min and max value, tempature can measured on a scale therefore it is a a continious feature type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cost: A feature to denote the cost of the observation (heating cost of a specific building on a month on some year), because we can measure different costs on a scale the feature is of type numerical continious.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target feature\n",
    "\n",
